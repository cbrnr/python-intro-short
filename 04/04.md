# 4 – Functions

Functions encapsulate code, or in other words, functions group lines of code that belong together. They promote reusability and prevent code duplication. For example, if you need to perform repeated calculations consisting of several lines of code, the corresponding code might be outsourced into a function. We will see examples of Python functions soon, but first we will discuss how to call and define functions.


## Calling functions

We have already mentioned that we *call* an existing function with its name followed by a pair of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, a function can accept arguments, which are specific values we provide when we call the function.

For example, we already saw the built-in functions `print` and `type`. Here's how we call these functions:

```python
>>> print("Hello")
Hello
>>> type("Hello")
str
```

Notice that both functions are called with one argument (the string `"Hello"` in this case). However, we can also call some functions without any argument:

```python
>>> print()

```

No matter how many arguments a function takes, we need to supply the *pair of parentheses* in order to call the function.

Calling a function instructs Python to *run* all lines of code belonging to that function. In the examples we've just shown, we do not even know which lines of code get executed when we run the `print` or `type` functions. However, this is not important as long as the functions do what they are supposed to do. This is what encapsulation actually means: a function encapsulates its code, and we can call a function without ever knowing what code it contains.


## Defining functions

We are not restricted to calling existing functions. In fact, we can create our own functions and they behave just like built-in functions. Here's how we define a function in Python using pseudo-code:

```
def function_name(<arg1>, <arg2>, ...):
    <do something>
    ...
    <optionally return something>
```

Let's break this down. A function definition starts with a function header introduced with the keyword `def`. Then we specify the function name (keeping in mind the naming rules we've already discussed) followed by a pair of parentheses. If our function requires additional information to do its job, we specify its parameters inside the parentheses (separated by commas). Each parameter gets its own name, and the function replaces all parameters with specific values that are provided when the function is called (these specific values are called *arguments*). Finally, the function header needs to be concluded with a `:`.

Next, we indent all lines that belong to the function body. That way, Python knows which lines to execute when we call the function. A function body can consist of one or several lines of code. If the function has parameters, their specific values are available within the function body (that is, parameter names get replaced with specific argument values). Optionally, a function can return a value (for example the result of a computation). This return value can be evaluated and used just like any expression.


### Example 1

Let's review some examples of simple functions. The following function is named `test1`, has no parameters, and its body consists of two lines of code. When called, the function internally assigns the name `s` to the string `"Hello World!"`, which it then prints to the screen. This function does not return a value.

```python
>>> def test1():
...    s = "Hello world!"
...    print(s)
```

When typing this function definition in the interactive interpreter, the prompt changes from `>>>` to `...` after the first line, because Python knows that the function definition is incomplete. As with the regular prompt, do not type the `...` characters when you define this function. If you copy these lines to a script, make sure to remove the prompt and all `...` occurrences.

Notice that running these three lines of code in Python does *not* actually *run* the function &ndash; they *define* the function so that Python now knows that a function `test1` exists. We have to *call* this function in order to run it:

```python
>>> test1()
Hello world!
```

As a side note, the name `s` used inside the function body does not exist outside the function, because a function body defines its own scope. Everything defined inside a function only exists within this function.


### Example 2

Let's modify the first example so that it returns a value. Here's our new function `test2`:

```python
>>> def test2():
...    s = "Hello world!"
...    return s
```

This function contains a `return` statement, which in this case means that the function returns `s` (which is equal to the string `"Hello world!"`) to the caller. After defining this function, we can call it:

```python
>>> test2()
'Hello world!'
```

Since we are using Python in interactive mode, the returned value is automatically printed on the screen. However, we can now continue to work with the returned value, for example by giving it a name:

```python
>>> h = test2()
```

Now the result of calling `test2` (its return value) is accessible with the name `h`, which refers to the string `'Hello world!'`:

```python
>>> h
'Hello world!'
>>> type(h)
str
```


### Example 3

Let's define an even more sophisticated function, this time we add two parameters `x` and `y`. The function should return the sum of these two parameters, which is why we call our function `add`:

```python
>>> def add(x, y):
...    return x + y
```

Once the `add` function is defined, we can call it with two arguments:

```python
>>> add(3, 7)
10
```

When the function is called, the arguments (the values `3` and `7` in this particular example) are used in place of the parameters `x` and `y` inside the function body. That's why the function returns `3 + 7` (evaluating to `10`).

Notice that we need to supply exactly two arguments when we call `add`. If we don't, Python will throw an error:

```python
>>> add(5)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: add() missing 1 required positional argument: 'y'
```

Because this function returns a value, Python will reduce a function call like `add(5, 5)` to its return value `10`. Using this knowledge, we can *compose* more complicated expressions as follows:

```python
>>> add(add(2, add(5, 7)), 9)
23
```

Working its way from inside out, Python replaces each function call with its returned value until the result cannot be reduced further. Here's a breakdown of the steps involved in the previous example:

```python
>>> add(add(2, add(5, 7)), 9)  # add(5, 7) is evaluated to 12
23
>>> add(add(2, 12), 9)  # add(2, 12) is evaluated to 14
23
>>> add(14, 9)  # add(14, 9) is evaluated to 23
23
```

Of course, we can also assign a name to the returned value if we want to use it later on:

```python
>>> a = add(add(2, add(5, 7)), 9)  # 23
>>> a - 20
3
```


## Defining default arguments

Python functions have an extremely useful feature. When defining a function, parameters can get default values, so-called default arguments. This means that parameters with default values are *optional* when the function is called &ndash; values for these optional parameters do not need to be passed.

Here's our `add` function definition from before, but this time the second parameter gets a default value of `1`:

```python
>>> def add(x, y=1):
...    return x + y
```

Now we can also call `add` with just one argument (`x`), because if we do not supply a value for `y` Python will use its default value of `1`:

```python
>>> add(5)
6
```

Note that we can still call the function with two arguments if we want to override the default value for `y`:

```python
>>> add(5, 3)
8
```


## Calling functions with keyword arguments

Normally, Python assigns arguments passed to a function call by *position*. That is, if we call `add(5, 3)`, the first parameter `x` gets the value `5`, and the second parameter `y` gets the value `3`. Specifying arguments in a function call by position is referred to as *positional arguments*.

However, this can quickly get unwieldy if a function has many parameters. Consider the following function definition:

```python
def many_args(a, b, c=0, d=1, e=0, f=5, g=5, h=0, i=-1):
   pass
```

Parameters `a` and `b` are mandatory, whereas the remaining seven parameters have default values (and are therefore optional). Let's assume we want to call the function with arguments `a=10` and `b=5`, and we want only one of the remaining seven parameters to differ from their default value &ndash; say, we only want `h=-5`. Using positional arguments, we need to include arguments for parameters that we do not want to change (because we need to get to the eigth parameter):

```python
many_args(10, 5, 0, 1, 0, 5, 5, -5)
```

This is where *keyword arguments* come to the rescue. Whenever we call a function, we can always explicitly include the parameter name in addition to its specific value like this:

```python
many_args(a=10, b=5, h=-5)
```

That way, arguments that keep their default values do not need to be passed to the function. In addition, keyword arguments make it obvious which arguments we are actually passing.

We can even mix positional and keyword arguments to optimize readability:

```python
many_args(10, 5, h=-5)
```

The first two arguments are matched by position, whereas the third argument is matched by name.

Here is another function to further illustrate the concept (taken directly from the [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#keyword-arguments)):

```python
def parrot(voltage, state='a stiff', action='voom', type='Norwegian Blue'):
    print("-- This parrot wouldn't", action, end=' ')
    print("if you put", voltage, "volts through it.")
    print("-- Lovely plumage, the", type)
    print("-- It's", state + "!")
```

The following function calls are valid (outputs omitted):

```python
# 1 positional argument
parrot(1000)

# 1 keyword argument
parrot(voltage=1000)

# 2 keyword arguments
parrot(voltage=1000000, action='VOOOOOM')

# 2 keyword arguments
parrot(action='VOOOOOM', voltage=1000000)

# 3 positional arguments
parrot('a million', 'bereft of life', 'jump')

# 1 positional, 1 keyword argument
parrot('a thousand', state='pushing up the daisies')
```

In contrast, all of these function calls produce an error (outputs omitted):

```python
# required argument 'voltage' missing
parrot()

# positional argument follows keyword argument
parrot(voltage=5.0, 'dead')

# multiple values for argument 'voltage'
parrot(110, voltage=220)

# unexpected keyword argument 'actor'
parrot(230, actor='John Cleese')
```


## Flow of execution

It is instructive to inspect how Python runs code. In general, Python executes code line by line, starting at the very top (the first line).

Whenever Python comes across a line containing a function header, it takes note that this functions exists, but it doesn't run the function body &ndash; this only happens when a function is called (as opposed to defined). Therefore, Python skips the function body and resumes at the first line after the function body.

Consider the following example:

```python
a = 5
print("Hello")

def test(x, y):
    x = x + 2
    y = y - 3
    return x * y

print("World")
z = test(5, 6)
print(z)
```

Let's see how Python runs this script step by step:

1. Python starts at the first line and assigns `a = 5`.
2. In the next line, we call the function `print("Hello")`. This function is a built-in function, so we don't know which code gets executed when we call this function (it is defined somewhere else outside our script).
3. Python registers our `test` function in the next line, taking note that this function requires two arguments `x` and `y` when called.
4. Now all of the lines in the function body are skipped, and Python runs the first statement after the function, namely `print("World")`.
5. Next, Python calls the `test` function with arguments `5` and `6`, so it jumps to the function header and assigns concrete values `x=5` and `y=6` to both parameters.
6. Python will now run the code in the function body. First, it computes `x + 2` and re-assigns the name `x` to this result (so `x` is now `7`).
7. Similarly, Python decreases the value of `y` by `3`, so `y` is now `3`.
8. The function returns the product `x * y`, which equals `7 * 3` or `21`.
9. Python is now back in the function call line and assigns the name `z` to the return value of the function, so `z` gets the value `21`.
10. Finally, Python calls the function `print(z)`, which prints `21` to the screen.
11. Python has reached the end of the script, so we're done.

You can run this example script interactively on [Python Tutor](http://www.pythontutor.com/visualize.html#mode=edit) &ndash; copy and paste the code and click on "Visualize Execution" to get a graphical step-by-step representation of what Python is doing behind the scenes.

Alternatively, you can use the debug facilities of Visual Studio Code to step through the code. First, click to the left of the first line number to create a breakpoint (a red circle). Then, click on the "Run and Debug" icon in the left sidebar and then on "Run and Debug". If you have not already saved your code, you will be prompted to do that now. When debugging for the first time, you are asked to select a debug mode – choose "Python File". Now Python will run the code up until it hits the first breakpoint, at which point it will pause execution. You can then inspect the current state and step through the remaining lines.


## Scope

In the previous example, the function `test` has two parameters `x` and `y`, which are only accessible *within* the function. These names do *not* exist outside the function, so they are bound to the local scope of that function.


### Example 1

Some additional examples further illustrate the scoping rules of Python. Consider the following function definition and subsequent function call:

```python
def test():
    s = 15  # s only exists in the function body
    print(s)

test()
```

The output when running this script is:
```python
15
```

Since `s` only exists in the function body (in its local scope), we get an error if we try to access it outside the function:

```python
>>> print(s)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 's' is not defined
```


### Example 2

Interestingly, we can access names from higher-level scopes without any problem. For example, we can use names defined in the global scope (outside of any function) inside a function body:

```python
s = 15  # global scope
def test():
    print(s)  # s from global scope

test()
print(s)
```

This is the output:
```python
15
15
```


### Example 3

In Python, local names can shadow global names. In the following example, the local name `s` inside the function body shadows the global name `s`. This means that inside the function, a different (local) name `s` is used. Outside the function, only the global `s` exists.

```python
s = 15

def test():
    s = 12  # local s shadows global s
    print(s)

test()
print(s)
```

This time, the output is:
```python
12
15
```


### Example 4

Now this is where things can get tricky. Inside functions, we can access global names, but we are only allowed to read their values and not modify them unless we take special measures. If a function contains an assignment to a name, this name is automatically treated as a local name. The following example will throw an error because the function is trying to change the local name before it is defined:

```python
s = 15

def test():
    print(s)  # local s does not exist yet, so we can't print it
    s = 12  # here we define our local s which shadows the global s
    print(s)
```

Calling that function results in an error:
```python
>>> test()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "<stdin>", line 2, in test
UnboundLocalError: local variable 's' referenced before assignment
```

If we really meant to access the global `s`, we need to tell Python by using the `global` statement:

```python
s = 15

def test():
    global s  # we want to access the global s
    print(s)
    s = 12  # modifies global s
    print(s)

test()
print(s)
```

This example now works and outputs:
```python
15
12
12
```


### Example 5

The solution to the previous example with the `global` statement is not ideal and should be avoided whenever possible. If you need to access a name from the global scope, it is better to pass this value to the function as an argument:

```python
s = 15

def test(s):
    print(s)
    s = 12
    print(s)

print(s)
test(s)
print(s)
```

Note that this does not change the global `s` because the function argument `s`
merely shadows it:
```python
15
15
12
15
```


### Example 6

If we also want to modify a value from the global scope, we could have the function return a value, which we can re-assign in global scope:

```python
s = 15

def test(s):
    print(s)
    s = 12
    print(s)
    return s

print(s)
s = test(s)
print(s)
```

This is a Pythonic solution and it yields the following output:
```python
15
15
12
12
```


## Exercises

1. Define a function `add_one` which increments and returns the supplied argument (a number) by 1. Then evaluate the following expression:
   ```python
   >>> add_one(add_one(add_one(13)))
   ```
2. Define a function `mult` which multiplies its two input arguments and returns their product. The second parameter should have a default value of `1` so that the function can also be called with only one argument. Test your function with the following three function calls:
   ```python
   >>> mult(3, 7)
   >>> mult(12)
   >>> mult(2, mult(8, 8))
   ```
3. Define a function `to_fahrenheit` which converts its argument (a temperature in degrees Celsius) to degrees Fahrenheit and returns this result. Furthermore, define another function `to_celsius` which performs the opposite conversion (from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius). Verify both functions with the following function calls (feel free to test additional temperature values):
   ```python
   >>> to_fahrenheit(0)
   >>> to_celsius(100)
   >>> to_celsius(to_fahrenheit(38))
   ```
4. Define a function `nonsense` with three parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`. Arguments `b` and `c` should be optional and default to `10` and `13`, respectively. The function should return the result of `a**2 - b * 2 + c**2`. Call the function in the following ways:

   - Without arguments
   - With three positional arguments
   - With two positional arguments
   - With one keyword argument
   - With two keyword arguments
   - With two positional and one keyword argument
   - With one positional and one keyword argument

   Write down each function call, each return value, and the values for each of the three arguments. Make sure that the function calls do not throw errors &ndash; this is always possible except for the first case (no arguments)!

8 â€“ Lists and tuples
====================
Creating lists
--------------
A list is a container sequence which, unlike strings, can contain elements of *arbitrary* types (even lists). We use square brackets to construct a new list (with commas separating the list elements):

```python
>>> x = [23, "Hello!", "test", 1.44, True]
>>> y = [1, "1", [1, 2, 3], ["test", False, [True, True, 2, 4]]]
```

Indexing and slicing
--------------------
Indexing and slicing works exactly like in strings. We use the indexing operator (square brackets) to extract single or multiple elements from a list:

```python
>>> x[0]
23
>>> x[-2]
1.44
>>> x[1:4]
['Hello!', 'test', 1.44]
>>> x[::-1]
[True, 1.44, 'test', 'Hello!', 23]
```

Working with lists
------------------
### Length
The `len` function returns the number of elements in a list:

```python
>>> len(x)
5
>>> len(y)
4
```

An empty list has length 0:

```python
>>> z = []
>>> len(z)
0
```

### Mutating lists
In constrast to strings, lists are mutable. That is, elements in a list can be modified after the list has been created. For example:

```python
>>> x
[23, 'Hello!', 'test', 1.44, True]
>>> x[1] = 12345  # no problem here
>>> x
[23, 12345, 'test', 1.44, True]
```

Remember that you can assign more than one name to a Python object. For example, you could create a second name `y` for the list that is currently named `x`:

```python
>>> y = x
```

If you modify the list, changes are visible through both names `x` and `y`, because the underlying list object is one and the same:

```python
>>> x[1] = "Good bye!"
>>> x
[23, 'Good bye!', 'test', 1.44, True]
>>> y
[23, 'Good bye!', 'test', 1.44, True]
```

The following example illustrates five possibilities to create a copy of the list `x` (or in other words, a new list):

```python
>>> import copy
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> x1 = x.copy()
>>> x2 = list(x)
>>> x3 = x[:]
>>> x4 = copy.copy(x)
>>> x5 = copy.deepcopy(x)
```

Note that if the list contains mutable objects (such as lists) itself, only `copy.deepcopy` will make copies from all objects (but this is also the slowest method).

### Concatenation
Adding lists with the `+` operator concatenates their elements and creates a new list:

```python
>>> [1, 2, "three"] + ["four", 5, 6.0]
[1, 2, 'three', 'four', 5, 6.0]
```

Likewise, the `*` concatenates list elements multiple times:

```python
>>> [1.0, 2, "three"] * 3
[1.0, 2, 'three', 1.0, 2, 'three', 1.0, 2, 'three']
```

### List methods
Lists have their own host of methods. Bear in mind that in general, list methods change the given list *in place*, whereas string methods always create a new string. One of the most frequently used methods is `append`, which (as the name implies) appends a new element at the end of the list:

```python
>>> x
[23, 12345, 'test', 1.44, True]
>>> x.append(13)
>>> x
[23, 12345, 'test', 1.44, True, 13]
```

If we want to append more than one element, we can use the related `extend` method:

```python
>>> x.extend(["A", "B", "C"])
>>> x
[23, 12345, 'test', 1.44, True, 13, 'A', 'B', 'C']
```

Note that `x.append(["A", "B", "C"])` also works but produces a different result &ndash; this appends one element, namely the list `["A", "B", "C"]`:

```python
>>> x.append(["A", "B", "C"])
>>> x
[23, 12345, 'test', 1.44, True, 13, 'A', 'B', 'C', ['A', 'B', 'C']]
```

The `del` command or the `pop` method both remove elements from a list. For example, this removes the two elements given by `x[1:3]`:

```python
>>> del x[1:3]
>>> x
[23, 1.44, True, 13, 'A', 'B', 'C', ['A', 'B', 'C']]
```

Similarly, this is how to remove the last element using `pop`:

```python
>>> x.pop(-1)
['A', 'B', 'C']
>>> x
[23, 1.44, True, 13, 'A', 'B', 'C']
```

Note that `pop` returns the removed element *and* changes the list in place (`del` does not return anything).

The `remove` method removes elements by value (instead of by index). For example, `x.remove(13)` removes the first element in the list which is equal to `13`:

```python
>>> x.remove(13)
>>> x
[23, 1.44, True, 'A', 'B', 'C']
```

Finally, the `sort` method sorts a list in place if this is possible. This means that all elements should be of the same type, otherwise sorting will result in an error.

```python
>>> x.sort()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'bool'
```

```python
>>> h = [6, 9, 23, 1, -78, 44]
>>> h.sort()
>>> h
[-78, 1, 6, 9, 23, 44]
```

### Iterating over lists
Just like we saw in strings, the `in` operator checks whether a specific value is contained in a list:

```python
>>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> 2 in x
True
>>> 7 in x
False
```

Iteration with a for-loop also works as expected:

```python
>>> for element in x:
...     print(element)
...
1
2
3
4
5
```

Tuples
------
On a superficial level, tuples are immutable lists. We will not go into more detail why tuples are useful, but suffice it to say that we should prefer a tuple instead of a list whenever we do not want to change its elements. For example, instead of storing the latitude and longitude of a given location in a list, a tuple might be more reasonable (because the coordinates of a given location will not change).

The syntax for creating a tuple is similar to creating a list, except that it doesn't use square brackets. Strictly speaking, listing elements separated by commas defines a tuple, but sometimes parentheses are required and/or improve readability.

```python
>>> t = 23, "Hello!", "test", 1.44, True
>>> t
(23, 'Hello!', 'test', 1.44, True)
```

We cannot modify tuples because they are immutable:

```python
>>> t[1]
'Hello!'
>>> t[1] = 12345
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment
```

List comprehensions
-------------------
There is another neat way to construct a list in Python. List comprehensions do not introduce any new functionality (everything can be accomplished without list comprehensions), but this so-called *syntactic sugar* makes some list assignments easier to read.

Consider the following example, where we want to create a list containing all squares from 1 to 10. We already know how to do this with a for-loop:

```python
squares = []
for n in range(1, 11):
    squares.append(n**2)
```

The resulting list looks as expected:

```python
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

An alternative list generation mechanism uses a list comprehension to build the same list. It is generally more compact and looks as follows:

```python
>>> squares = [n**2 for n in range(1, 11)]
>>> squares
[1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
```

In general, a list comprehension is surrounded by square brackets (to denote that a list will be constructed). Inside the brackets, the first expression defines the individual elements that go into the new list (`n**2` in our example). After that, something very similar to a for-loop iterates over some sequence (some iterable) to generate the individual elements (in our case, `n` takes on values from `range(1, 11)`).

Here's another example of a list comprehension, which multiplies each element in a (numeric) list by 2:

```python
>>> numbers = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]
>>> numbers2 = [n * 2 for n in numbers]
>>> numbers2
[-8, -4, 0, 4, 8]
```

Every time we want to apply some operation to each individual element in a list, a list comprehension might be the way to go. Another example is taking the absolute value of each element in a list:

```python
>>> numbers_abs = [abs(x) for x in numbers]
>>> numbers_abs
[4, 2, 0, 2, 4]
```

Remember that all of these list comprehensions can be written with a regular loop and the `append` method. We can also include a condition in the list comprehension, which will include an element in the new list only if the condition is `True`. This is useful for filtering values as shown in the following example, where we filter out all values greater than or equal to zero:

```python
>>> [x for x in numbers if x >= 0]
[0, 2, 4]
```

List comprehensions can even be nested:

```python
>>> lst = [(x - 1, y - 2) for x in [1, 2, 3] for y in [3, 1, 4] if x != y]
>>> lst
[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 1), (1, -1), (1, 2), (2, -1), (2, 2)]
```

This is a pretty complex list comprehension already, and in this case the traditional way might be more readable:

```python
lst = []  # start with an empty list
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    for y in [3, 1, 4]:
        if x != y:
            lst.append((x - 1, y - 2))
```

The results are exactly the same (observe how the individual `for` and `if` statements correspond to each other in both list assignments).

Let's finish up this topic with a slightly less complex list comprehension just to see another example:

```python
>>> freshfruit = ['  banana', '  loganberry ', 'passion fruit  ']
>>> [weapon.strip().upper() + "!" for weapon in freshfruit]
['BANANA!', 'LOGANBERRY!', 'PASSION FRUIT!']
```


Exercises
---------
1. Write a function `histogram`, which accepts a list of numbers as its input argument. The function should convert the argument to a simple (vertical) histogram as follows: Each element of the list defines a row in the histogram, the length of which is defined by the value in the list. By default, the histogram should consist of `*` characters (but it should be possible to change this character with a second argument).

   Here are two examples that demonstrate the behavior of the function:

   ```python
   >>> histogram([1, 8, 5, 17, 14, 9, 2])
   *
   ********
   *****
   *****************
   **************
   *********
   **
   >>> histogram([1, 8, 5, 17, 2], char="-")
   -
   --------
   -----
   -----------------
   --
   ```

   Use the `print` function to print the histogram row by row. Repeating a string might be useful, for example `"*" * 8` is `"********"`.

2. Define a function `sum_of_squares` which takes a list of numbers and returns the sum of all squared elements (one number). Note that the built-in function `sum` computes the sum of a list of numbers.

3. Create a list `numbers` consisting of the 25 integers from 1 to 25. Based on this list, generate the following five new lists:
   - `squares` containing the squared numbers
   - `evens` containing the even numbers
   - `odds` containing the odd numbers
   - `roots` containing the square roots of the numbers
   - `logs` containing the natural logarithms of the numbers

   For the last two lists, use the functions `sqrt` and `log` from the `math` module (first, `import math` and then use the functions as `math.sqrt` and `math.log`, respectively).

4. Find out what is wrong with the following code:
   ```python
   >>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]
   >>> x = x.append(5)
   ```

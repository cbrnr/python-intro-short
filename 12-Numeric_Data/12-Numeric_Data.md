12 â€“ Numeric data
=================
Introduction
------------
The [NumPy](https://numpy.org/) package is the basis for numeric computing in Python. Almost all packages involving numeric data of some sort are based on NumPy.

In a nutshell, NumPy revolves around a data type optimized for numeric data: the *n*-dimensional homogeneous array ("ndarray" for short). Although we could work with Python lists (containing numeric values), these data types are optimized for holding elements of arbitrary types. Therefore, lists are said to be containers or heterogeneous arrays. This flexibility comes at a cost: lists are generally much less efficient when dealing with homogeneous (numeric) data &ndash; in other words, they consume more memory and operations are typically slower than NumPy ndarrays. In contrast, NumPy ndarrays are homogeneous arrays, which means that all elements in an ndarray must have the same type. This makes them much faster and memory-efficient than Python lists.

In summary, whenever you work with numeric data you should consider using NumPy.

The absolute basics for beginners
---------------------------------
For now, I refer to the official NumPy tutorial for absolute beginners available here:

https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/absolute_beginners.html

This is an excellent tutorial that highlights the most important NumPy features required to efficiently work with the package. It covers many topics, so be prepared to spend some time working through all examples. In an upcoming version of this course I will provide an even shorter description of the most essential points (something like "The absolutely absolute basics for beginners").

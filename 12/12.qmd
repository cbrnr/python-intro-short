## Introduction

This section contains additional exercises to practice the concepts learned in the previous sections. This is still work in progress, so more exercises will be added over time.


## Exercise 1

Write a function `collatz` that takes a positive integer `n` as an argument and returns a list of the [Collatz sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) starting with `n`. The Collatz sequence is defined as follows: if `n` is even, the next number is half of `n`. If `n` is odd, the next number is three times `n` plus 1. The sequence ends when it reaches 1.
